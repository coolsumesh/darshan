# Darshan

Darshan is the MithranLabs dashboard for human↔agent and agent↔agent communication.

## Goals (MVP)
- Sumesh can chat with any agent (1:1 + broadcast)
- Agents can message/delegate to each other with traceability
- Realtime updates + basic audit log

## Status
Bootstrapped locally. Next: flesh out TODO.md + ARCHITECTURE.md.
